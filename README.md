## Graph Signal Processing on Gain Graphs

- Here we perform signal denoising using Gain normalized laplacian and compare our results with those using [Hermitian Laplacian](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-46150-8_27) and state-of-the-art [feasible Method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8309026).
- Empirically, we show that gain normalized Laplacian achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of signal denoising, as measured by denosing error, and more importantly, offers rich theory backing the experimental observations. In particular, it outperforms state-of-the-art [feasible Method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8309026), and in weighted case, performs better than the recently defined [Hermitian Laplacian](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-46150-8_27).
- We have obtained the orthogonal matrix `U.mat` from running the Feasible Method and using the code provided in [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-012-0584-1) paper. All other experimentals results with corresponding code has been provided in the notebook `Graph Signal Processing on Gain Graphs.ipynb`.
