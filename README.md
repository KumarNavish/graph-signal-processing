## Graph Signal Processing on Gain Graphs

- Here we perform signal denoising using Gan normalized laplacian and [Hemitian Laplacian](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-46150-8_27).
- We compare these two methods and find that denoising error in gain case is lower than that for Hermitian case, implying that Gain Graphs are naturally suitable for signal processing.
