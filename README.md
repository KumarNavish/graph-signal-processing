## Graph Signal Processing on Gain Graphs

- Here we perform signal denoising using Gain normalized laplacian and compare our results with those using [Hemitian Laplacian](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-46150-8_27) and state-of-the-art feasible [Feasible Method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8309026).
